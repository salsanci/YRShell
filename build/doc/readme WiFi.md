# YRshell WiFi support

Initial support for WiFi for YRshell is using the ESP8266MON hardware module.  These are inexpensive, about $25 USD for 5 parts on Amazon at the time of this writing. This module includes and Ardunio compatible microcontroller. 

Using the ARduino tool, add 8266 support.  Also add LittleFS support (little file system).  YRshell uses these support libraries like any other Arduino program. YRshell iteslf know what to do this these libraries and accesses WIFi.
